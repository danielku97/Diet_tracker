Thanks for downloading and checking out my project.

Unfortunately, I've decided to discontinue work on the project and focus on other ones, which all should be stored on my github :)

The main reason I've decided to discontinue this project is mainly due to a quality of content issue.

How do you know how much food you've eaten? It's difficult to accurately input how much food you've eaten to calculate nutritional value. 
On another note, the database is limited and would incur additional costs to have a complete nutritional database.

The closest solution is to use standardized meal portions, eg. One portion of fruit/ one portion of meat. This still suffered from the issue of a lack of complete database, and is a rough approximation at best.




To do List
- Change string input to a button, no clue what I was thinking when string matching food rather than a button input
- Reformat UI to be more concise, also its ugly at the moment 
- Add more nutritional value standards for other audience demographics
- Enable users to set their goals for their own desired nutritional values
- Add feature to enable export of user's daily values
